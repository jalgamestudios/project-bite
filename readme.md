# Project Bite

## Our plan
Some time ago, I noticed how inexpensive it was to purchase transistors on Amazon. So naturally, I ordered a few hundred, which arrived a month later, as they were shipped from China. I had also ordered a few resistors and some other electronic components, so in theory I had everything required to build circuits.

After some simple experiments, I lost the will to continue, so I put the Breadboard away and left it in a drawer for half a year. When we had to choose what to do in our computer Science class, Luis and I decided to use the components to make something. We anticipated hitting some difficulties, so we decided not to set any specific goals, instead making up new goals as we went along.















##Transistors
The fundamental building block of modern computers is a transistor. In the simplest form, it is a digital switch. There is a input and output, called collector and emitter, allow current to flow, but only if there is a voltage at the middle pin, which is called the base.
###NPN-Transistors
Our transistors made of silicone (well, most of it was plastic, but the interesting bit is made of silicone). The silicone inside is arranged like a sandwich, in a negative-positive-negative order (NPN). This is done in a process called doping. Negatively doped silicone means that there are free elctrons that can move around and transmit electricity. Positively doped silicone works in the opposite way. Here, there are not enough electrons, which creats "holes" in the silicone structure.
