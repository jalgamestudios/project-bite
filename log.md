#Captains' Log

12.12.2016

Today I added the log (as a folder) and tried to tweak the movement.
One can still walk up certain walls, but not all. 
I thought variable changing did usefiul things and indeed you are slower when walking up slopes, 
but you can still walk up some walls.

I then tried to again look through the code and find some bug or mistake allowing this.

Today I found out about interfaces. The are mask-ish things you can use to have a single class contain mulitple different things with different properties.
I started implemeting a component based interdface using Entity system, but the different (interfaced) components are yet to be added.

2 Hours After this: got our grades, thought about the future of our project, thinking about making more of an engine and less of a game because art.

23.1.17
Adding xml type things for more config options like window size and fullscreen-nes

7.2.17 
Listened to a very interesting talk about HTML

9.2.17
Worked on my very own Markdown to HTML converter
Looked at new project possibilities
	Transistors are the s***

14.2.17
looked at an XOR Gate layout and DIY PCBs

16.2.17
Finished our html stuff and made a stylesheet in CSS

21.2.2017
Gathered more information on transistor and chip based "computers" 

1.3.2017
Learned that DIY PCB's aren't feasable, they're expensive, a lot more effort than soldering directly and the chemicals are strong acids i dont want to have around (because of the fumes).

2.3.2017
Found the alternative of our choice: small (10cm*5cm) plastic boards with holes which conduct electricity between three holes each

8.3.2017
Made AND gates and XOR gates wich are required for half/full adders

9.3.2017
Made our first "batch" of NAND gates after we chose to make a binary clock because an adder would be too much.

14.3.2017
Mostly figured out the JK clocked Flip Flop design, doesn't seem to work tho 

16.3.2017
changed some Cables, resistors and a broken transitor and we have our first working Flip Flop!

21.3.2017
have 2,5 working Flip Flops that work independently

23.3.2017
Connected them up and added transitors for less signal loss, improved our bouncing with a bigger capacitor
They sorta work.
